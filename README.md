#### [useInView](https://github.com/f22hd/custom-hooks) (main branch)
 it is an event will fire when an element displayed in screen view. it can be used to add animation, loading heavy content, lazy loading for images ...etc.

#### [useInfiniteScroll](https://github.com/f22hd/custom-hooks/tree/infinite-scroll) (infinite-scroll)
